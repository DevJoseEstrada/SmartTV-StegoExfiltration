# SmartTV-StegoExfiltration
 SmartTV-StegoExfiltration is a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the covert exfiltration of data using visual steganography on Smart TVs. This project showcases how sensitive information can be hidden within a TV's display and transmitted undetected to a variety of camera-equipped devices, such as tablets, Google Nest Hub, Amazon Echo Show, or security systems. The repository contains a complete implementation of the system, including an Android TV application that acts as a transmitter and a cross-platform receiver application built with Flutter. The project is part of a Master's thesis in Cybersecurity at Universidad Cat√≥lica de Murcia (UCAM) and is intended for academic research and further exploration in the field of cybersecurity.
